Please refer to `pycls/core/config.py` to configure your experiments at a deeper level. 


## Execution Commands
### Active Learning
Once the config file is configured appropriately, perform DBAL active learning with the following command inside the `tools` directory. 

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python train_al.py \
    --cfg=../configs/cifar10/al/RESNET18.yaml --al=dbal --exp-name=YOUR_EXPERIMENT_NAME
```

### Ensemble Active Learning 

Watch out for the ensemble options in the config file. This setting by default using _Ensemble Variation-Ratio_ as the query method. 

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python ensemble_al.py \
    --cfg=../configs/cifar10/al/RESNET18.yaml --exp-name=YOUR_EXPERIMENT_NAME
```

### Passive Learning

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python train.py \
    --cfg=../configs/cifar10/train/RESNET18.yaml --exp-name=YOUR_EXPERIMENT_NAME
```

### Ensemble Passive Learning

Watch out for the ensemble options in the config file.

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python ensemble_train.py \
    --cfg=../configs/cifar10/train/RESNET18_ENS.yaml --exp-name=YOUR_EXPERIMENT_NAME
```

### Specific Model Evaluation

This is useful if you want to evaluate a particular saved model. Pass the path to the model in the yaml file. Refer to the file inside the `config/evaluate` directory for clarity. 

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python test_model.py \
    --cfg configs/cifar10/evaluate/RESNET18.yaml
```


## Add Your Own Dataset 

To add your own dataset, you need to do the following: 
1. Write the PyTorch Dataset code for your custom dataset (or you could directly use the ones [PyTorch provides](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/datasets.html)). 
2. Create a sub class of the above Dataset with some desirable modifications and add it to the `pycls/datasets/custom_datasets.py`.
    * We add two new variables to the dataset - a boolean flag `no_aug` and `test_transform`. 
    * We set the flag `no_aug = True` before iterating through unlabeled and the validations dataloaders so that data doesn't get augmented. 
    * See how we modify the `__get_item__` function to achieve that:
```
class CIFAR10(torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10):
      def __init__(self, root, train, transform, test_transform, download=True):
          super(CIFAR10, self).__init__(root, train, transform=transform, download=download)
          self.test_transform = test_transform
          self.no_aug = False
  
      def __getitem__(self, index: int):
          """
          Args:
              index (int): Index
  
          Returns:
              tuple: (image, target) where target is index of the target class.
          """
          img, target = self.data[index], self.targets[index]
  
          # doing this so that it is consistent with all other datasets
          # to return a PIL Image
          img = Image.fromarray(img)
          
          ##########################
          # set True before iterating through unlabeled or validation set
          if self.no_aug: 
              if self.test_transform is not None:
                  img = self.test_transform(img)            
          else:
              if self.transform is not None:
                  img = self.transform(img)
          #########################
          
          return img, target
```
3. Add your dataset in `pycls/dataset/data.py` 
    * Add appropriate preprocessing steps to `getPreprocessOps` 
    * Add the dataset call to `getDataset`
4. Create appropriate config `yaml` files and use them for training AL.


## Some Comments About Our Toolkit
* Our toolkit currently only supports 'SGD' (with learning rate scheduler)  and 'Adam' (no scheduler). 
* We log everything. Our toolkit saves the indices of the initial labeled pool, samples queried each episode, episode wise best model, visual plots for "Iteration vs Loss", "Epoch vs Val Accuracy", "Episode vs Test Accuracy" and more. Please check an experiment's logs at `output/CIFAR10/resnet18/ENT_1/` for clarity.
* We added dropout (p=0.5) to all our models just before the final fully connected layer. We do this to allow the DBAL and BALD query methods to work.
* We also provide an iPython notebook that aggregates results directly from the experiment folders. You can find it at `output/results_aggregator.ipynb`. 
* If you add your own dataset, please make sure you to create the custom version as explained in point 2 in the instructions. Failing to do that would mean that your unlabeled data (big red flag for AL) and validation data will have been augmentated. This is because we use a single dataset instance and subset and index based dataloaders.   
* We tested the toolkit only on a Linux machine with Python 3.8.
* Please create an issue with appropriate details:
  * if you are unable to get the toolkit to work or run into any problems
  * if we have not provided credits correctly to the rightful owner (please attach proof)
  * if you notice any flaws in the implementation
